# Amr-Ali-OS-simulation-HackClub-Flavortown
AMR-OS 4.0 Teen Edition is a terminal operating system that simulates a digital world with agents, an economy, emotions, and growth systems that all depend on each other. It has missions, random events, a memory system, a scripting virtual machine, and a live dashboard.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌟 **World Simulation:** Agents roam around, have energy, and do stuff.  
- 🧠 **Neural Networks:** Each agent thinks and moves based on its own mini brain.  
- 💰 **Wealth Engine:** Trade, risk, and grow your capital over time.  
- 🎯 **Goals & Missions:** Set objectives, complete missions, and grow your stats.  
- 📚 **Memory & Knowledge:** Store info, recall it later, and link concepts together.  
- ⚡ **Events & Evolution:** Random events shake up the world and agents evolve.  
- 🖥️ **Dashboard:** See your world live in the terminal with agents, stats, and maps.  
- 📝 **StackVM Scripts:** Run tiny programs to control the system or test ideas.


Important:
To run the program upload the 2 files to your IDE separately and then run the main_program.py file
